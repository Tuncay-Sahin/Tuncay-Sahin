- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tuncay-Sahin  
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science & CS, modular documentation, Python, and collaborative technical education with AI-augmented learning.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for data science and analysis, modular documentation pipelines, and AI-enhanced learning in finance — while developing personal growth as modular releases.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that integrate Data Science with modular growth through MY Versioning System. Always iterating. Always modular. v2026: Technical Individual in progress.  
- 📫 Reach me via GitHub.
